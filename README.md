# OdinGameMasterAdditions

A mod that enhances the gamemaster mode with several tools and QoL improvements:

## Features

- Delete All Dead, on a right-click context action to easily delete all dead bodies/units. Makes it easy to clean up.

- Enable Damage, is toggled in the attributes on units/player. Handy to make gamemaster player immortal to avoid getting randomly shot by AI and have to reset radios. 

- Stance attribute for the AI groups so you can control their stance

- Formation attribute for the AI groups to control the formation the AI will move in. 

- Skill attribute for the AI groups. You can control the AI skill level. 

- Cycle Waypoint, you can now add the familiar cycle waypoint to make AI move in repeated patterns

- Waypoint completion radius and type attributes.
